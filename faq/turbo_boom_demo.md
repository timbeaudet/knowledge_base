# Building a Turbo Boom! Demo for Steam

## What is the plan?

Pause technical / engine work for the month of December to build and release a demo of Turbo Boom! on Steam. After the demo is launched work will return to techincal / engine stuff while the demo continues to accumulate wishlists and interest in the game. IF we can hit a large (2750) number of wishlists before engine work is finished (or Feb 14th, 2025) then full version of Turbo Boom! will be the first project in 2025.

## What can you do?

Share announcements and content and try getting people to see/know about Turbo Boom! 2750 wishlists should be plausible target with your help!
