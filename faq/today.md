# Objectives for Today 2024-08-07

### Time Block 1: (First 3ish Hours)
- Catching --platform from the post_build scripts (batch & bash)
- Grabbing all the branches on rhino and ensuring we still build
- Refactor & cleanup of make_project.sh (on rhino) to add features & make it more generic if possible.

### Time Block 2:
- Continuing nightly build / build system maintenance.
- Add a Hello World / Example Project to TurtleBrains (an executable)
  - The executable will help solve linker issues faster than TurtleBrains > ICE > TrackBuilder > TrophyBrawlers
  - The executable is also needed for running TurtleBrains unit test with --test for nightlies (as planned).
- Fix the 64bit windows issues
- Update the development reports and today notes for the following day.

### Time Block 3: (12pm - 3pm ish)
- Probably the rest of day off, don't push too hard.
