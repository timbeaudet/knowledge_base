# Objectives for Today 2024-12-20

- Physics of Tires & Terrible Brakes in ICE!
- What is happening with the primary collider slamming into the ground on the Vehicle Drop test?
  - This seems to cause front wheels to stay fully compressed, I think CoM issue?
  - **Why does the vehicle suddenly drop FASTER as the wheels start touching the ground?**
- Why is the ICE version going faster than the Unity version?
- Maybe a diagnostic display for spring compression for each wheel on the vehicle diagnostics screen.
