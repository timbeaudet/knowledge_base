# Objectives for Today 2025-01-07

- Investigate why particles are discolored (likely due to bloom/ao upgrades of 2022)
- Fix the discolored particles
- At least 1 hour of art practice or improving visuals for Turbo Boom!
- Maybe more demo work, demonstration not demolition!
- Fix the missile launch direction, something messed up the transforms - probably something changed in engine maths.
- Fix the User Interface scaling wrong at 1280x720 (working okay at 1080p)
- Fix the Window startup position/size (this doesn't save... probably because old versions would constantly move)
