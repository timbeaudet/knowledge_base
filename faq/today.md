# Objectives for Today 2024-03-06

### Time Block 1: (6am - 9am ish)
- Update the Development Reports
- Start digging into TrackBuilder unit tests (2 tests already failing to investigate)
  
### Time Block 2: (9am - 12pm ish)
- Continue investing already failing TrackBuilder test (DaisyChain'ed prefab test)
- Implement Component property updates so that test can start passing.
- Ensure if a unit test fails, the developer is VERY aware of it (to avoid this situation)

### Time Block 3: (12pm - 3pm ish)
- See where energy is at.
- Go for a 15 minute walk outside & touch grass (like I do in iRacing)
