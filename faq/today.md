# Objectives for Today 2024-10-24

- Continue working root / single node prefabs retaining scale/rotation etc on instantiation.
- This will break old tests that expected prefab roots to be at the origin.
- Very unlikely, but maybe trying to create a Rigidbody component, and add non static/global colliders to a Node.

Among other Track Builder painpoints from LudumDare 56 weekend.
