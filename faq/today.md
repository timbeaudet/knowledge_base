- Physics of Tires & Terrible Brakes in ICE!
- What is happening with the primary collider slamming into the ground on the Vehicle Drop test?
  - This seems to cause front wheels to stay fully compressed, I think CoM issue?
  - **Why does the vehicle suddenly drop FASTER as the wheels start touching the ground?**

- Maybe a diagnostic display for spring compression for each wheel on the vehicle diagnostics screen.
  - Objective: Diagnose if the spring compression is causing the spin issues.
