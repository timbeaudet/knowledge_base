# Objectives for Today 2025-02-03

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Update the KPIs of the adventure.
- Update the Weekly plans for Week #6
- Update a Weekly topic on Reddits?
- Post another job posting for Turbo Boom!?
- PAY DAY, gotta pay ourselves and rent - ugh.
- Market research (collecting all the racing games on Steam January 2025)
- Write an announment for Turbo Boom! something about the demo! (maybe Artist hired?)
- Write on the prefab article series?
- Art practice, create a new hexagon tile!

TOMORROW: Try seeing how much time it would take to peek at the "released yesterday" games and make a content post of it.
  Theory: Telling fans of racing/driving games that games are out, might be a good way to build a base of the right general audience.

## Events / Notices / Coming Soon

- Circle back to Turtle Brains Scene management and add 'transition scenes'.
Continue the 3am experiment until end of January, normal 6am-2 schedule for February
