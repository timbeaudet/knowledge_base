# Objectives for Today 2025-11-08

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Diving into git, should I use tags for version even in TurtleBrains etc too?
- Moving TurtleBrains back to main? And jumping to v0.4.4 to begin breaking the API.
- Testing and figuring out how to create Template To/From DynamicStructure that is also "Project Safe"
  - Project Safe meaning easy to specialize without extending a TurtleBrains namespace (may need global space)
  - Also want to figure out how to OPTIONALLY pass debug information to at least FROM DynStruct.
- Once we have that solution, we shall apply it to Read/Write Binary and To/From String.
- Continue down the list of API breaking changes in Core, Graphics and other Kits.
