# Objectives for Today 2025-02-04

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Get Turtle Bot reauthorized (need to eventually automate...)
- Create the Tyre Bytes Tool Box to start supporting Steam Leaderboards & more.
- Art practice, create a new hexagon tile!
- Write on the prefab article series?

- Try seeing how much time it would take to peek at the "released yesterday" games and make a content post of it.
  Theory: Telling fans of racing/driving games that games are out, might be a good way to build a base of the right general audience.

## Events / Notices / Coming Soon

- Circle back to Turtle Brains Scene management and add 'transition scenes'.
Normal 6am-2 schedule for February
