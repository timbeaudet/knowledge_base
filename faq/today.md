# Objectives for Today 2024-12-17

- Physics of Tires & Terrible Brakes in ICE!
- What is the sprung mass of each of the wheels in TerribleBrakes Unity?
- How much does that differ from TerribleBrakes in ICE? (And how can we make it more similar!)
- Maybe a diagnostic display for spring compression for each wheel on the vehicle diagnostics screen.
