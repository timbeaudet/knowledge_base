# Objectives for Today 2024-01-07

### Time Block 1: (6am - 9am ish)
- Jump back in the middle of the ice/exporter/viewer issues from Yesterday, see if we can fix.
- Figure out how to extract the Animation Bone data (hierarchy & keyframes) from armatures / NLA sequences.
  - Keeping support for the parent structure (might) be worthwhile, but don't fight it too hard.

### Time Block 2: (9am - 12pm ish)
- Continue writing the Blender exporter, will need to start defining version/data being added.
- If that problem is resolved, maybe spend some cleanup time in iceModelViewer; can consilidate a lot.
- 
### Time Block 3: (12pm - 3pm ish)
- Animation, Exporter, just chilling; it is Saturday
