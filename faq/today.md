# Objectives for Today 2025-01-30

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Find a way to actually disable Steam stuff when not steam build! (shakesoda hitting weird issue, possible race condition?)
- Investigate a way to enable hot-reloading of engine shaders... this will be: tricky.
- Circle back to Turtle Brains Scene management and add 'transition scenes'.
- Maybe writing on the Prefab System Series of Articles later.
