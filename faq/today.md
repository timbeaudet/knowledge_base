# Objectives for Today 2024-11-13

- Keep trying to tackle the BasicSlip physics model & matching Unity/PhysX
- Start by dropping a constrained 'test rig' with a spring, sensors for wheel/rig position
- Then attempt to match longitudinal slip forces and interactions
- And attempt to match lateral slip forces and interactions

(later / tomorrow)

- How to get friction model to match?
- Trying to get the friction model to be very close to typical slip model of Unity/Physics etc so that Terrible Brakes can feel right.
- That slip model should fix the sudden spin around issue we've had in Trophy Brawlers; too much grip.

## Events / Notices / Coming Soon
