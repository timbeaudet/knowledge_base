# Objectives for Today 2024-11-06

- Mashing Terrible Brakes (LD50) into Trophy Brawlers for physics testing.
- Trying to get the friction model to be very close to typical slip model of Unity/Physics etc so that Terrible Brakes can feel right.
- That slip model should fix the sudden spin around issue we've had in Trophy Brawlers; too much grip.
