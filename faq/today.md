# Objectives for Today 2025-10-31

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Happy Halloween! 24 Hour Party Stream

## Halloween Stream GameDev
- Environment and SearchableTargets from data driven sources.
- Prototype the Fog being hard-attached to the mouse
- Probably messing with the Drag Race logic; trying to get ties when expected.
- Settings Scene Popup with Music/Sound Volume, Reset Game?
- Much needed focus on Tech Tree with 'choke points' for balancing
- Add content for quests and unlock the first quest at somepoint that makes sense.
- Unlock "Challengers" once the player reaches level 10.
- Unlock "The Camp" through tech tree (probably early for testing, it might enable at 60+ minutes in final version).
- Add an "Alert" icon to the Challengers / Quests / Camp buttons when something is active.
- HOPING: If we got far enough in racing we should have tech upgrades for the car & multiple drivers.

## Halloween Stream Extras!
- 9am ET: Pumpkin Carving
- Costume Reveal at some random time, probably with the pushups.
- Costume stays ON the rest of stream starting 4-5pm ET until bed.
- Foodie Friday: Mongolian Chicken
