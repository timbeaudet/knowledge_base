# Objectives for Today 2025-02-06

- Just Chatting as we Get started & warmed up.
- Try figuring out RefreshTokens in TurtleBot (keeps requiring manual reauth)
- Assuming that is quick & easy (hahaha) TurtleBot also needs ping/keepalive etc for WebSocket Events.
- Art practice, create a new hexagon tile!
- Write on the prefab article series?

## Events / Notices / Coming Soon


- Create the Tyre Bytes Tool Box to start supporting Steam Leaderboards & more.
  - Ghosts. Turbo Boom has allowed player to select which ghost to watch, not just WR and NB.
- Circle back to Turtle Brains Scene management and add 'transition scenes'.
Normal 6am-2 schedule for February
