# Building Snailed It! in Godot

Due to the physics issues in Internal Combustion Engine and a VERY large forward step with Node/Components in Track Builder which were slowing the Snailed It! prototype down, decisions were made to jump Godot. This move is specifically for Snailed It! and not for future projects. This is to keep Snailed It! on the initial schedule and budget without dealing with the growing pains from the engine.

The physics issues were a suprise unknown that popped up mostly due snails not being vehicles and having unique movements. Other issues with Track Builder improvements and the animation system were predicted and known growing pains, but the combination with physics got overwhelming for this particular project.

## What version of Godot?
Godot 4.2, possibly 4.3 when it comes out

## GDScript or C#?
GDScript will be used since when in Rome...

## Why Godot for ONLY Snailed It!

Because my [reasons for my own engine](https://github.com/timbeaudet/knowledge_base/blob/main/faq/why_my_own_engine.md) have not changed for the big picture. My hand feels a little forced to choose Godot in the first place but it seems to be the best 'right-now' choice for the project. For my simulator and future racing games, Turtle Brains, Internal Combustion Engine and Track Builder will continue being the primary tech stack.



## What is the Plan:

For the first week Tim is exploring Godot and won't be focused directly on Snailed It! Instead recreating a portion of Mechanic Heroes/Overcooked like gameplay. Replacing wheels on a car, with a slight driving of the car and having a few levels that share objects as you would find in a production game.

Hopefully during that week there will also be some learning and playing with the Godot multiplayer and maybe having a few bodies moving around the shop / environment.

There will also be LudumDare 55 over the weekend where I will use Godot for more practice and the game jamming session and jumping into Snailed It! right after.
