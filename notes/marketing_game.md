# Marketing an Indie Game

### Collect the Facts
- What are all of the facts about your game?
- Who are the founders, roles, location, background, expertise...

### Essential Questions
- Why are you?
- What makes you special?
- Why should people like you?
- Why should people like your company?
- Why should people like your game?

### Target Audience
- These are the _people_ who will buy your game.
- They will shape your company and future games.
- Who do you _want_ as your customers?

## Building a Steam/Itch.io Page for a Game
### Do
- Add key features
- Add screenshots of unique aspects to game info panel.
- Release story-based games in episodic/season based content.
- Toss in fitting 'banner / header' like gameplay gifs.
- Consider adding an area of the screenshots with text, to tell story as prospective player travels through.
	Something like "Build your own tracks", "Keep Car Mechanically Sound", etc...
- Add a TL;DR at top of the giant wall of text if you must have a giant wall of text - better not to have a giant wall of text.
- Ensure the thumbnail image of the game is sized well (aspect/cropping)
- Include a GIF thumbnail if possible.
- Include GIF action in the about this game; useful because sometimes the video is chunky and a new player will skip a page without
	seeing the awesome content.
- Use screenshots of the SAME size.
- Ensure the screenshot order shows the juiciest shots first
- Add tags. LOADS of tags. Use official tags whe possible. Find similar games and see the tags they use for ideas.

### Do if release Early Access:
- Put WIP / EA / In Development etc in the screenshots / video. (top banner/corner flag etc)
	This should help a user make slightly better judgments while sifting through media if they haven't already seen that it is an early access game. Otherwise they might be quick to judge lower quality when in actuality it is still being improved.
- Answer (or strongly consider) the following questions, even if unnessary by platform, FROM PLAYER VALUE PERSPECTIVE:
	- "Why Early Access?" (must)
	- "What is different from full game"
	- "How long will it be in Early Access?"
	- "Will game be priced differently during/after Early Access"
- Ensure the release date is set INTO THE FUTURE if game is in early access.
	This is very confusing and some player feel the game is released and judge it as so.
	That said, players do not give early access games much slack in the first place.


### Do not
- Make trailers with zero (0) gameplay footage.
- Reference other games; "like PUBG with wands"
- Lie about your content or feature set.
- Forget to put the game title, in any game/trailer footage.
- "Coming Soon" with "Release Date" of today/in the past.
	It would seem if you can put a future release date on things, that one could forget their or slip by their intended release date.
- Simply show the game settings screen.
- Have software watermarks (Bandicam, Fraps etc) in screenshots or videos.
- Have too many features listed or bulleted, unless they are truly outstanding.
- Attempt to make your trailer in less than 3 hours.
- Use a huge image for Engine Logo, and/or include a bunch of engine tech/features.
- Use screenshots of varying size.

	2) Then tell them what you want them to do.
	3) Make sure generally the tweet offers value to them.
	4) Links should go before the #hashtags

	use hashtags (when they make sense):
