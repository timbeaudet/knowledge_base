# Marketing an Indie Game

### Collect the Facts
- What are all of the facts about your game?
- Who are the founders, roles, location, background, expertise...

### Essential Questions
- Why are you?
- What makes you special?
- Why should people like you?
- Why should people like your company?
- Why should people like your game?

### Target Audience
- These are the _people_ who will buy your game.
- They will shape your company and future games.
- Who do you _want_ as your customers?

## Building a Steam/Itch.io Page for a Game
### Do
- Add key features
- Add screenshots of unique aspects to game info panel.
- Remove all old/legacy screenshots, they are likely inconsistent with final product.
- Release story-based games in episodic/season based content.
- Toss in fitting 'banner / header' like gameplay gifs.
- Consider adding an area of the screenshots with text, to tell story as prospective player travels through.
	Something like "Build your own tracks", "Keep Car Mechanically Sound", etc...
- Add a TL;DR at top of the giant wall of text if you must have a giant wall of text - better not to have a giant wall of text.
- Ensure the thumbnail image of the game is sized well (aspect/cropping)
- Include a GIF thumbnail if possible.
- Include GIF action in the about this game; useful because sometimes the video is chunky and a new player will skip a page without
	seeing the awesome content.
- Use screenshots of the SAME size.
- Ensure the screenshot order shows the juiciest shots first
- Add tags. LOADS of tags. Use official tags whe possible. Find similar games and see the tags they use for ideas.
- Make sure to use a spellchecker for the text material posted.
- Read it outloud a few times and try finding any oddities in posted text.
- Give features a short title/headline then add details. Use colors of [MXGP](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1259800/MXGP_2020__The_Official_Motocross_Videogame/)

### Do if release Early Access:
- Put WIP / EA / In Development etc in the screenshots / video. (top banner/corner flag etc)
	This should help a user make slightly better judgments while sifting through media if they haven't already seen that it is an early access game. Otherwise they might be quick to judge lower quality when in actuality it is still being improved.
- Answer (or strongly consider) the following questions, even if unnessary by platform, FROM PLAYER VALUE PERSPECTIVE:
	- "Why Early Access?" (must)
	- "What is different from full game"
	- "How long will it be in Early Access?"
	- "Will game be priced differently during/after Early Access"
- Ensure the release date is set INTO THE FUTURE if game is in early access.
	This is very confusing and some player feel the game is released and judge it as so.
	That said, players do not give early access games much slack in the first place.
- Give features a short title/headline then add details.


### Do not
- Make trailers with zero (0) gameplay footage.
- Make videos with no music or audio, this screams low-value.
- Reference other games; "like PUBG with wands"
- Lie about your content or feature set.
- Forget to put the game title, in any game/trailer footage.
- "Coming Soon" with "Release Date" of today/in the past.
	It would seem if you can put a future release date on things, that one could forget their or slip by their intended release date.
- Simply show the game settings screen.
- Have software watermarks (Bandicam, Fraps etc) in screenshots or videos.
- Have too many features listed or bulleted, unless they are truly outstanding.
- Attempt to make your trailer in less than 3 hours.
- Use a huge image for Engine Logo, and/or include a bunch of engine tech/features.
- Use screenshots of varying size.
- Use a screenshot very similar to another screenshot already in use.
- Don’t repeat a line right after it.
- Don’t write your life story.
- Don’t write the backstory of your game world.
- Don’t put images, especially moving ones, between each feature point. [Forza](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/)

### **Yucky** Steam Behaviors that Seem to Give an Edge

- List your game as free-to-play even if it is not out yet, people may click and then wishlist.
- Update the "release date" to pop back up the lists as if newly released.

## Posting Steam News for the Game

This certainly helps at least a little, both by keeping existing game community in the loop and also for attracting new views. At least for original Eggcelerate! the "Regular Update" got major views and almost certainly increased sales. With Tropics it seemed I only stuck with "News" and this might have been part of the lower sales issues. Consider use of other categories especially "Upcoming Release" and "Game Release". These put little news items on the game page that makes it look a little more lively than without.

## How to use Twitter

- Grab them in a few words.
- Then tell them what you want them to do.
- Make sure generally the tweet offers value to them.
- Links should go before the #hashtags.
	- use hashtags (when they make sense)
	- #earlyaccess #screenshotsaturday #indiegame #indiedev #gamedev

## How to use Reddit

- Images (esp gif/motion) and media seem to increase hotness.
- Tutorials (perhaps more hit miss with lots of words)
	- Use of gif/image/video showing steps seem to work well.
- Text articles should be reaching _maximum_ of 1 to 1.5pgs.
	- Few hits were longer, but definitely shorter is better.
- Text articles seem to do well if written about the following topics:
	- Something really bad happened. [optionally add: and I made it good]
	- Major event that others wish to live. [I quit my job to go indie]
	- I worked X hours, years etc on whatever. [postmortem like, use numbers, time tracking]
	- I worked X hours,  or I worked Y years ... game is out
