### Vector Cross-Products

Cross-Products can be visualized by taking the left-side parameter and drawing an arc to the right-side parameter using the smallest angle between. So axis, X and Y and getting cross(X, Y) would draw the arc in the 90 degree region rather than 270 degrees. This would cause (assuming X is right, and Y is up) a counter-clockwise arc from X to Y. Imagine a (REGULAR/CW TIGHTENING) screw and twist in the direction of the arc, in this case it would loosen and pull out of the plane. This is the direction the cross product will point, and give us the Z axis in a Right-Handed System.
	
Note: for a left handed system you turn the imaginary screw the other direction so Z would go into the plane).
