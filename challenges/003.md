# Challenge 3

Create _something_ and release it publicly **in April**.

## Publicly Release a Creation of Yours!

- Release a demo of your game!
- Create and release a trailer of your project.
- Write and release a book!

## Rule Clarifictions

Creation of Yours means you had a very large part in the creation, idea, development, process, but getting help from others is acceptable.

## Due Date

While you can perform this challenge at any time, the projects will be shared on stream May 2nd 2025. Submit your project along with a list of tasks completed by May 1st 2025.

## To Submit (wip)

Presently, just submit via a comment on the ["Challenge 003 Submission"](https://github.com/timbeaudet/knowledge_base/issues/14) issue ticket with the format specified.
  
Submission process is new and very open for ideas. The goal is track submissions long term, allowing anyone to submit at anytime, link to the project and track the list of things completed. Ideally, eventually, it would be nice to see what challenges a particluar user completed as well.
  
Objective is to reduce friction but track who did what and when.
