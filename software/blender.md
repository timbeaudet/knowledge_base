# Blender Tricks:
> Nearly all this help comes from (shakesoda) or (ZaCkOX1000)
> Some of this information was originally written with Blender 2.79; most still applies to 2.80.

## User Interface (2.80)

- Bottom of the window, status bar, shows what LMB, MMB and RMB does at seemingly any time, with a glance.
- "Header Menu" is usually positioned at the top, if loading from 2.79 it may be located on the bottom.
	- You can change in Edit > Preferences > Interface > Editors > Header Position (Top or Bottom), default is by file.



## Techniques

### Playing with Texture Coordinates (UV Unwrapping)

- Select on edge in uv editor, and use `W` menu to `set align (auto/x/y)` to get straight lines.
- In vertex mode (of UV editor) use `W` menu to `Weld` (or `W`, `W`) to lock two vertices together.

### Sliding along an Edge

- Purpose: Slide an edge along the edges it is connected to, or a vertex along the connect edges.
- Hotkey: `G`, `G`
- Holding `ALT` will allow movement beyond the initial edge in the same edge direction it is locked to.

## Modifiers

### Using Mirror Modifier on Cylinder (with ngon caps)

1. Use `z` to see transparently.
2. Lock view to axis with numpad buttons.
3. Select and delete half of the shape.
4. Click on the end cap, press `y` to split the polygon then `w` menu to use symmetrize.
5. Delete half of the shape.
6. Remove doubles with `a` to select, `w` menu to use `remove doubles`
7. Repeat for other cap and mirror modify the shape.

### Make selection fall on a plane

1. Set orientation to 'Normal' mode, (as opposed to Global)
2. Select the faces that should remain planar.
3. Press `s` to scale.
4. Press `z` then `z` to scale along z-normal axis.
5. Press `0` to set that scale to zero.

> Note this can't fix the issue of quads turning in multiple axis, (like a racetrack turning while changing elevation pitch.).

### Make something symmetric (without mirror modifier)

1. Make selection.
2. `w` menu `symmetrize`
3. Use the tool menu to specify direction/threshold

## Edit Mode Tool and Usage Tips

### Modes
- 2.79 Hotkey: `CTRL+TAB` with `v` for vertices, `e` for edges and `f` for faces.
- 2.80 Pressing `1`, `2` or `3` will change to vertices, edges or faces respectively.
	- Holding `SHIFT` while pressing `1`, `2`, or `3` will multiselct modes.

- Purpose: Change between what gets selected or modified during edit mode manipulators like grab, scale, rotate etc.
- **NOTE:** Edit in multiple modes, at the same time by shift-select the modes (_vertices, edges, faces_) on the bottom panel.

### Selecting Things

> No setup notes yet, but I believe the default is not left click select, which is used in the following section.

- Left click to select an individual _(vertex, edge or face)_.
- `ALT+LMB` to loop select (when built properly)
- `CTRL+NUMPAD+` or `CTRL+NUMPAD-` to extend/decrease loop selections.
- Press `L` to select the entire linked area under the mouse, or `CTRL+L` to select entire linked area to current selection.
- Use `SHIFT+G` to perform all sorts of neat selection tricks related to something already selected. This tool has options (bottom-left) to modify.

### Hiding / Unhiding (showing) Things

- Press `NUMPAD+/` to hide everything except the selections.
- Press `H` to hide current selection.
- Press `ALT+H` to unhide, everything?
- Hold `CTRL` while clicking the eye-ball icon in the Outliner / scene list to hide children objects as well.

## Helpful Workflows

### Creating Tubed Pipes / Track Surfaces

- Create a curve, `SHIFT+A` Curve > Bezier Curve
- In the Curve Properties tab, _above Materials_, adjust Bevel Depth/Resolution
	- Resolution of 0 is 4 sided, 1 is 6, 2 is 8 ...
- Manipulate the curve as desired, remember you can change the type of a specic handle with `V`
- Note: Blender may choose Z as the "normal" axis for deformation which is the reason why tilt 90 may be required to get a track surface to remain flat. As to why Y vs -Y acts differently with tilt, just mess around with it I guess.

#### When doing it manually with cylinder mesh / already to-meshed tube

- Create circle with the desired radius and position of the curve you want.
- Set the cursor to center of circle.
- Loop select the cap-edge of the pipe/cylinder.
- Use the spin tool to spin.
- Caveat: This might only work well with global axis?

### Layout of a track or object

- Start with empty scene, add a plane, enter edit-mode, `A` `delete` (all)
- Ensure to enter vertex mode, if nothing happens this is a reason why.
- Using `CTRL+RMB` add vertices / edges to create the track (or general layout thoughts)
- Helpful to create curves by selecting vertex and pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+B`
	- Use scroll wheel to add more segments (smoother curves)
	- Move mouse position to change shape.
- For a racetrack, when finished with layout:
	- Duplicate the object with `SHIFT+D`, hide original, select the duplicate.
	- Cleanup unnessary bits/layout thoughts
	- In Object Mode, Object -> Convert To Curve
- Make several things FLAT respective to eachother
	- Select the Normal transform (usually on global, icon of 3D gimbal)
	- s, z, z, 0

### Painted Texturing Process

- Create, and finalize the shape of the model before anything further. When happy
	- remove any big useless polygons before moving on (or any useless polygons)
- Apply all modifiers (or primarily the ones that generate geometry: mirror)
- Join any parts that are separate that should be on the object (house and chimney)
- Select all in edit mode and press `U` to choose `Smart UV Project` then pray.
	- Use the menu the pops up to add margins so the separated parts don't paint over seams.


### Texturing Tips in General

- Enable selection sync is useful... It is the two diagnoal opposite arrows in "view header"
- To avoid pain when painting use unified colors (header menu in Texture Paint: Brush -> unified colors and such)


## Creating a Render

- To position the render camera move your view camera as desired then select the Camera object and press `CTRL+ALT+Numpad0`
	- It can help to position using the flying camera which is `SHIFT+~` in Blender 2.8
	- If you accidentally set your camera to another object, because that is possible, fix it by
		- Open Scene Properties (a few icons above modifier icon) and choose the camera in Camera slot.
- If having issues with lights leaking through connected objects try turning on Contact Shadows.
	- Access this by selecting each light and in the light properties there is a Contact Shadows checkbox.

## Create a Wireframe Render

- Use the Wireframe modifier on your mesh.
- If too busy, make a copy of the object and set an emissive, plain colored material.
- Use an emissive plain black/colored material for the original mesh.
- You may want a plane with the same plain colored emissive material for the render.
- Limitation; this techique does not allow for a transparent render/video.

## Intersecting an Edge with a Face

This used to test ray and box intersection stuff. Blender 4.0.2

- Set snap tool to face, and use CTRL or turn on snap
- Subdivide or grab an edge with "grab grab" mode to restrict to motion along the ray.
- Done, profit. If that is broken (it was in the past, use the steps below)

Longer steps in case the above simple solution fails;
- Select the edge representing the ray.
- Change Global orientation to a Custom with +"
- Next to magnet, change snap mode to Face
- Use one of the end-points, or subdivide the edge and grab the middle...
- Restrict to Y axis and snap (with CTRL) to land on the face of intersection.
- Delete Custom edge orientation by selecting it and pressing the X

### Unformatted mess:
	Mirror as a one off, immediately using menus: `Object > Mirror` which is not a modifier.
	alm-m to merge vertices.
	'c' to use circle select, to left-click/paint selection (shift to unselect paint area)
	ctrl-mouse (RMB) to lasso select

	button-to right of face select mode button can be used to select things on the other side. (ghost thingy)
	bevel tool: ctrl-b, use scroll wheel for more loops
	alt-s to scale along normals (or shrink/fatten in words of (shakesoda)

	Use period to put the origin/scale/things with the cursor as the hotspot.
	Use comma to put the origin/scale/things to the selection.

	Proportional Edit Mode
	alt-o to enter/exit proportional edit mode
	Check the area of influence (use scroll wheel)

	- **Split a mesh into smaller parts**
		In edit mode, select the parts/faces desired in the new part
		then press `p` and use `selection` to break it apart into a new mesh.

	- **Joining two meshes together, with same surface loops**
		In object mode, select the meshes to be joined.
		Press `ctrl-j` to join them into a single mesh.
		In edit mode, select the edges of the two peices to be combined and bridge
			Bridge via space 'bridge' or `w` menu `e` ... also or ... `ctrl-e` menu `l`

	- Snapping to various things
		Bottom right of 3D view has 'closest' next to that is a mode, vertex, edge, increment etc.
		Grab item to move to snapped location, lock in axis if needed,
		Hover thgy

	Working with Materials:
		Don't hit [+] New unless a new material is required, use the ball next to it to select a material.
		To delete a material from that list: 

	ctrl-x to dissolve an edge loop (or other things) S
	shift-k in vertex paint mode to fill
	v is a hotkey to go to vertex paint/to object mode

	shift-f free move (fps) camera can use LEFT-CLICK to set the view and return to edit.
		in Blender 2.8+ this is now `SHIFT+~`
	shift-f1 to open/copy an object/something from one blend file into current.

	select, then scale 0 on the Z (or other axis) to create a flat spot)
	hit axis key a second time (g, x, x) to move along normal

	ctrl numpad +/- to increase/decrease selections
	to slice a model- 'a' to select all, then use 'bisect' (select fill, clear inner/outer to taste)
	knife tool 'k' to create new 
	While in color mode, use s to sample the color under cursor. (perhaps just UV/Image editor?)

	m to move an object from one layer to another.


	☐ Mesh cleanup, remove doubles with:
		In edit-mode, select all `a` then
		`w` menu `r` for remove doubles

	☐ `Copy a mesh`
		Do NOT use ctrl-c/ctrl-v (shakesoda says this litters the file with junk; as in
		it also duplicates the materials and stuff.)
		☐ Use `alt-d` to link and share same object data
		☐ Use `shift-d` to duplicate the mesh without sharing.


	☐ Splitting a curve into multiple segments
		Select both nodes that should be split, press `w` then `s` to subdivide.

	Select child object first, then parent next and hit `CTRL+P` to link.
		To unparent an object, select the child then press `ALT+P`

	☐ `Playing with the 3D Cursor`s
	alt-home centers the rotation to 3d cursor

	☐ `Extrude along perpendicular`
	Select the edge, `e` to extrude, `escape` to cancel movement, `alt-s` to move along normal.

	tab to edit mode
	grab the bottom edge (or desired rotation point)
	`SHIFT+S` cursor to selected
		in 2.8 you can use `SHIFT+S` then `2` to avoid mouse move/click.
	period (regular keyboard) to switch 3D cursor pivot   (comma to set back to average)
	tab to object mode
	rotate etc

	`Permanently change center point in object mode to move origin to geometry or cursor`
	ctrl-alt-shift-c

	EXPORTING LEVEL:
		DO NOT SAVE DURING THIS PROCESS
		box-select all tiles/objects
		relations tab on T menu: make local (all)
		box-select all tiles/objects (again)
		ctrl-shift-a (make duplicates real)
		relations tab on T menu: make single user (check option for "object data")
		Apply transforms
		Export
		DO NOT SAVE
		File > Revert


	Color palette:
		https://puu.sh/BcZLm/b148cf14df.png File >preferences >File,
		set textures directory if not already.
		Then go open C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons\paint_palette.py 
			insert in to line 110 "searchpaths=[bpy.context.user_preferences.filepaths.texture_directory]"
			save it.
		Back to preferences in blender Add-on tab,
			search paint,
			and enable pallet
		finally migrate you pallet to the other pallet using the eye dropper in the colour picker.
		
	Animation:
		Good luck!
		Display the bones on top of the mesh for easier selection by
			- Select the Armature
			- Use the Armature menu (human like skeleton icon where modifiers/materials live)
			- Open Viewport Display and check the box "In Front"
		Jump to start / end of animation with `SHIFT+LEFT` or `SHIFT+RIGHT`
