# How to Split the Steam Payout by Project

For this example we are assuming the last payout received was March 2024. If no payouts have ever been received then account for ALL the months that steam gives data.

Open the "financial info" and then find Reports on the top bar.
Since the last payout was IN March 2024, open the reports starting from March 2024 until the next payout happens.
On the Indie Career Tracker planner sheet, Month 1 becomes "March 2024"
At the top of the March 2024 Report (on Steam) It says All platforms, and Revenue Share on the very right, grab the Total for each game.
(Note: Eggcelerate to the North Pole and Tropics ordering is different in Steam vs the sheet because of appids...)
Then open April 2024 Report, and so on adding each Total to the Payout Break down in Month 1, 2, ... N etc.

Once the total on the Indie Career Tracker planner sheet matches the current payout (say June 2024) copy that data into the Income sheet for the project specific entries.
